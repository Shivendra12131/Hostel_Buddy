# Inspiration
 A few days ago, on my friend's birthday, I wasn't able to get any speakers. So an idea came into my mind. That there should be something that can help people borrow things from others easily. So I and my friends thought of creating a website that could serve our needs, so we created this website, HostelBuddy. Which can help us to lend and borrow things among ourselves.
# What it does
By using our website, we can lend things like food, medicine, clothes, shoes and many others. This site can be very useful for people in emergencies. For example, if a person has a sudden fever or headache in the night when he can't access any medical shops, in that scenario, our website can be very useful as He or she can directly find any available medicines among the students. This can be very useful. We can use this website to help students who are in need of a particular thing or medicine. etc., we also inculcate in our students the feeling of sharing among ourselves, which enhances their social skills. By this website, we can connect the students of our college on a single platform where each one can help others and get helped themselves.
